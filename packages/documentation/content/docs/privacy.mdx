Last updated: June 29, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to the VideoRoll browser extension and its related services ("Service"). Please read this Policy carefully before using the Service to understand how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information. We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy rights of all users.

## Data Collection and Use

- We do not collect any data generated within the extension. All data is stored using browser vendor APIs, such as the storage API of Chrome/Edge/Firefox. VideoRoll does not actively collect any data generated during your use of the extension.
- When you use VideoRoll for related operations, all relevant data is processed locally in your browser and is not uploaded to our servers.
- If you choose to use Pro membership or other advanced features, you may need to log in (e.g., via email or third-party accounts). This information is used solely for authentication and service provision, not for any other purpose.
- We do not actively collect any sensitive personal information such as bank card numbers or ID numbers.

## Data Sharing

- We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal data to any third party, except as required by law or with your explicit consent.
- Some advanced features (such as cloud sync or third-party login) may involve third-party service providers (e.g., Google, Github). We only share necessary information with these providers when you authorize it, and require them to comply with relevant privacy protection standards.
- We do not use your data for advertising or marketing purposes.

## Data Storage and Security

- Most data is stored only in your local browser and is not uploaded to our servers.
- We use industry-standard security technologies and management practices to prevent data loss, misuse, or unauthorized access.

## Permissions

- The VideoRoll extension may request permissions to access the content of the web pages you visit, download management, clipboard, storage, etc., solely to enable core features.
- We will not use your permissions beyond the stated scope, nor will we access your private data without your authorization.
- You can view and manage extension permissions at any time in your browser's extension management page.

## Third-Party Services

- VideoRoll may integrate third-party services (such as third-party login). Please refer to the official privacy policies of these service providers for details.
- We recommend that you read the privacy policies of third-party services before using related features.

## Data Deletion
