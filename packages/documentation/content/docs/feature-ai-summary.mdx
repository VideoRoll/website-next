## Model Detection and Download
Since it uses the browser's built-in AI model, it will first detect whether your browser and device support model download. If supported, a green checkmark icon will be displayed, indicating the model is available.
>Note: If the model remains in downloading state, please check your network connection or try upgrading your browser version.
